Helios 1.4.2018.0915 Beta is not an explicit collaboration with Craig Courtney, but it
relies heavily on the original Helios. This distribution is not endorsed by Craig Courtney.
                                                                     
This code is beta code, as is the installer.

If you encounter problems, please check for known issues here https://github.com/BlueFinBima/helios/issues
and if nothing appears to be relevant then open a new issue.

* * * Before Installation * * *

1)  Make a complete back-up of your %userprofile%\Helios directory.  I take no responsibility for messing up your
    current Helios profiles

2)  Ensure that you back up all of your existing Exports.lua scripts and the like.  I am not expecting that the 
    A-10C interface will change the Exports.LUA from the original Helios one if you install it from this level 
    but it might do.  If you install the scripting from the new AV-8B intereface, it will *definitely* replace 
    the current export.lua
      
3)  Uninstall Helios 1.3 (you can always get it back from http://www.gadrocsworkshop.com/helios/latest )

4)  You can choose not to Uninstall Helios 1.3 and install this code to a different directory and this should work ok.  
    * However * there are no claims of backward compatibility of profiles so if you edit a profile with this release
    of Helios, then it is likely to cause problems if you attempt to open it again in an older version of Helios so 
    point 1 above is very important. 

5)  Make sure you virus scan the installation.  I believe my build system to be virus free, however I make no claims
    that it is virus free, and I take no responsibility for any damage to your system as a result of installation of
    Helios or its install mechanism.

6)  The exectuables are not currently signed so a warning for this will be issued during installation and running of the
    software.  It is completely your decision and risk if you ignore warnings.

* * * After Installation * * *

1)  If you add the AV-8B Interface into a profile, you will need to deploy the Exports.lua for the AV-8B interface for it
    to communicate between DCS and the Helios Control Center.  If you leave the Helios A-10C Exports.lua in place, then the 
    result will not be pleasant.

None
