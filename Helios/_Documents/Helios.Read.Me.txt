Helios 1.4.2020.02xx is not an explicit collaboration with Craig Courtney, 
but it relies heavily on the original Helios.  This distribution is not endorsed 
by Craig Courtney.  
                                                                     
If you encounter problems, please check for known issues here 
https://github.com/BlueFinBima/helios/issues and if nothing appears to be 
relevant then open a new issue.
  
* * * Before Installation * * *

1) Make a complete back-up of your %userprofile%\Helios directory.  I take no 
responsibility for messing up your current Helios profiles 

2) Ensure that you back up all of your existing Exports.lua scripts and the 
like.  I am not expecting that the A-10C interface will change the Exports.LUA 
from the original Helios 1.3 version, assuming that if you install from this 
level, however it might do.  If you install the scripting from the new AV-8B or 
MiG-21Bis intereface, it will *definitely* replace the current export.lua 
      
3) Uninstall Helios 1.3 (you can always get it back from 
http://www.gadrocsworkshop.com/helios/latest (if the site is working)) 

4) You can choose not to Uninstall Helios 1.3 and install this code to a 
different directory and this should work ok.  * However * there are no claims of 
the backward compatibility of profiles so if you edit a profile with this 
release of Helios, then it is likely to cause problems if you attempt to open it 
again in an older version of Helios so point 1 above is very important.  

5) Make sure you virus scan the installation.  I believe my build system to be 
virus free, however I make no claims that it is virus free, and I take no 
responsibility for any damage to your system as a result of installation of 
Helios or its install mechanism.  

6) The exectuables are not currently signed so a warning for this will be issued 
during installation and running of the software.  It is completely your decision 
and risk if you ignore warnings.  

* * * After Installation * * *

1) If you add an aircraft Interface into a profile, you will need to 
deploy the Exports.lua from the aircraft interface panel in profile editor for it to 
communicate between DCS and the Helios Control Center.  If you leave the Helios 
A-10C Exports.lua in place, then the result will not be pleasant.  

2) The KeypressReceiver.exe is used for receiving Helios keypresses 
when DCS is installed on a separate PC.  
There is an installer for the KeyPress Receiver for installing it on your PC running.
Set the server IP address to the IP address of your Helios PC and open port 9088 
(fixed port for now) on the Helios PC.
The receiver is not required for instances where Helios runs on the DCS PC.

3) if you continue to use a custom Export.Lua and want to take advantage of the 
added "Disconnect" event then modify your export.lua to contain:
<code>
function LuaExportStop()
-- Works once just after mission stop.
-- Send DISCONNECT message so we can fire the Helios Disconnect event
    socket.try(c:sendto("DISCONNECT\n", gHost, gPort))
    c:close()
end
</code>

4)  1.4.2019.0908 & 1.4.2019.1005 have made minor breaks in backward compatibility
	for the AV-8B

* * * Known issues and work arounds * * *

Loss of bindings on Reset Monitors https://github.com/BlueFinBima/Helios/issues/117
	Save the profile after doing a reset monitor.  The problem appears to happen 
	after two successive reset monitors.

The Keypress server means that you might get a firewall popup from the keyboard interface
when it attempts to find out if there is a Keypress receiver running on a remote PC
